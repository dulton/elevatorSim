All builds are classified as 3-tuples. The 3-tuple consists of the cpu architecture, the host 
operating system family, and the compiler name and version separated by periods. So, the major 
supported build for this project currently is (x86, winnt, msvc2010), or x86.winnt.msvc2010.

For tier one platforms, pre-cooked libraries are included in-tree and so building should be as easy
as invoking (n)make. For other platforms building is still possible but more work will be required.
Due to time constraints, an elaborate build system is a low priority item.

Dependencies:
    boost 1.51.0/boost 1.50
    fltk 1.3.0

If attempting builds for platforms which do not include pre-built binaries, either replace the 
header files included in-tree or make sure to build the _exact_ version of the dependencies
and place them in the correct subdirectory of ./deps to avoid conflicts between binaries
and headers.    

Tier one platforms: x86.winnt.msvc2010

to build for this T1 3-tuple, the easy way:

1. double click on elevatorSim.sln
2. click the green 'play button'
3. ???
4. rejoice

to build for this T1 3-tuple, the hard way:

1. first run vcvarsall.bat x86 from a shell, or just use (Visual Studio Command Prompt 2010 x86),
to ensure that the Microsoft compilers and binary utilities are in your PATH.

2. > cd [..]\elevatorSim,
to ensure that you are in the correct directory containing the source for this project.

3a. > nmake /nologo /f makefile.x86.winnt.msvc2010
to tell the shell to interpret the makefile metascript and issue commands required for compilation
and linking.

3b. alternately you can run build.bat which will simply invoke the command listed in 3a

if the build succeeds, the resulting statically linked binary will reside in the current directory.

Tier two platforms: x86_64 debian linux

To build on debian linux:

aptitude install libboost1.50-dev-all libfltk1.3-dev libfltk1.3-compat-headers
cd /path/to/elevatorSim
make -f makefile.x86_64.linux.gcc4

You can also use the eclipse CDT.
